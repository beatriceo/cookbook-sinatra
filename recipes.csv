Cheese souffle,"
Method :

 Preheat oven to 180°C (356°F) (gas mark 6). Butter the mold. Heat the butter in a saucepan, add flour and stir rapidly for 1 min. Add the warm milk, whisk for a few minutes over low heat. Remove the pan from the fire. Separate the whites and beat them firmly (with a pinch of salt). In a cooled pan, add the egg yolks one by one, then the grated cheese. Put a pinch of nutmeg and pepper. Add a little salt, because the cheese already contains salt. Add in the beaten egg whites and gently mix. Pour into the mold at most up to 4 cm from the edge. Bake for 35 minutes in convection oven.


 Advice :
